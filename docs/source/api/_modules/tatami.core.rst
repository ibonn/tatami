tatami.core ðŸ§ 
==============

This module contains the core building blocks of Tatami, like the base `Tatami` app itself, the `Router` class, and the `run()` function that sets everything in motion.

These are the things you'll be using (or subclassing) most often when building an app with Tatami.
