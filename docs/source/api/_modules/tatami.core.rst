tatami.core ðŸ§ 
==============

This module contains the core building blocks of Tatami. Currently, it only contains the base `TatamiObject` class that other framework components inherit from.

.. note::
   This module is minimal in the current version. The main functionality is in `tatami.router` and `tatami.endpoint`.
