Tatami - The clean, modular Python web floorplan
================================================

**Tatami** is a lightweight, Starlette-based Python web framework that uses a declarative routing approach and built-in OpenAPI documentation.

This guide contains developer-facing documentation for working with the Tatami framework, including usage examples, architecture concepts, and a generated API reference.

.. important::
   Heads up! 🚧 Tatami is still in early stages — a bit experimental and very much a work in progress. Expect rough edges, missing features, and the occasional breaking change. Feedback is super welcome!

Philosophy
----------

Tatami is a minimal, convention-powered web framework that builds your application from the ground up — guided by your directory structure, not boilerplate or ceremony.

Like traditional *tatami* mats that structure a Japanese room, Tatami lets you define the shape and flow of your web app naturally, simply by laying things out.
